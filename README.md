# Shapemaker

## Overview
Partmaker is a tool for doing demonstration CNC cuts.  It is written by Jonathan Ward.

## Building
To compile the project into a FabMo app, just run `make` - A FabMo app package called `shapemaker.fma` will be created.

## Running
To run the app standalone, just open index.html in Firefox (Chrome will not work by default, and must have its security settings adjusted due to the way processing.js loads the processing code)
